# Game of Life #
The Game of Life represents the life cycle of a colony of cells. Live cells 
are represented by the character 'O' on a grid, the size of which is set by 
the user. Each cell is randomly set to alive or dead, then displayed. The 
next generation is calculated by the count of a cell's live neighbors, the 
display updates, and so on.
